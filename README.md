# Image Classification
This is the Repository for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models to perform image classification. The objective of case study is to compare various models with minimal feature engineering techniques.

## Data Description
For demonstraton we are going to use [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels), as seen here:

Fashion MNIST is intended as a drop-in replacement for the classic [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) datasetâ€”often used as the "Hello, World" of machine learning programs for computer vision. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0, 1, 2, etc.) in a format identical to that of the articles of clothing you'll use here.

This guide uses Fashion MNIST for variety, and because it's a slightly more challenging problem than regular MNIST. Both datasets are relatively small and are used to verify that an algorithm works as expected. They're good starting points to test and debug code.

Here, 60,000 images are used to train the network and 10,000 images to evaluate how accurately the network learned to classify images. You can access the Fashion MNIST directly from TensorFlow. Import and load the Fashion MNIST data directly from TensorFlow:

## Code

The solution is split into Exploratory data analysis and Model Building. 

Exploratory data analysis results are stored in below notebook.

1. `Exploratory data analysis.ipynb`

Below are the notebooks for Models:

1. `Image Classification - Keras TF2.0.ipyb` for TF Keras based classification

You need to have [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) installed to run the file

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
